# How to Set Up GitHub Wiki

I've created comprehensive wiki content for your Wealth Wars project. Here's how to add it to your GitHub repository wiki:

## üìã Steps to Create GitHub Wiki

### 1. Enable Wiki on GitHub
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/SerStakeAlot/Wealth-Wars
2. Click on the **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to the **"Features"** section
4. Check the box next to **"Wikis"**
5. Click **"Save changes"**

### 2. Access Your Wiki
1. Go back to your repository main page
2. You'll now see a **"Wiki"** tab next to Code, Issues, etc.
3. Click on the **"Wiki"** tab
4. Click **"Create the first page"**

### 3. Create Wiki Pages

I've prepared the following pages for you in the `/wiki-content` folder:

#### **Home Page** (Main wiki landing page)
- Copy content from: `wiki-content/Home.md`
- This will be the main navigation hub

#### **Game Overview** 
- Copy content from: `wiki-content/Game-Overview.md`
- Complete gameplay mechanics and learning objectives

#### **Tokenomics**
- Copy content from: `wiki-content/Tokenomics.md`
- Full economic model and $WEALTH token details

#### **Getting Started**
- Copy content from: `wiki-content/Getting-Started.md`
- Player onboarding and tutorial guide

### 4. How to Add Each Page

For each page:
1. In your GitHub wiki, click **"New Page"**
2. Enter the page title (exactly as listed above)
3. Copy the content from the corresponding `.md` file
4. Paste it into the GitHub wiki editor
5. Click **"Save Page"**

### 5. Recommended Page Order

Create pages in this order for best navigation:
1. **Home** (main landing page)
2. **Getting Started** (player tutorial)
3. **Game Overview** (complete game explanation)
4. **Tokenomics** (economic model)

### 6. Additional Pages to Create Later

You can also create these pages using content from your `/docs` folder:
- **Development Roadmap** (copy from `docs/ROADMAP.md`)
- **FAQ** (create based on common questions)
- **Community Guidelines** (create for community management)

## üìÅ Wiki Content Location

All prepared content is in: `/workspaces/Wealth-Wars/wiki-content/`

Files created:
- ‚úÖ `Home.md` - Main wiki navigation
- ‚úÖ `Game-Overview.md` - Complete game explanation  
- ‚úÖ `Tokenomics.md` - Economic model details
- ‚úÖ `Getting-Started.md` - Player tutorial guide

## üéØ After Setup

Once your wiki is live, you can:
1. **Link from README**: Add wiki links to your main README.md
2. **Share with Community**: Direct players to wiki for detailed information
3. **Keep Updated**: Add new pages as features are developed
4. **Collect Feedback**: Use wiki discussions for community input
