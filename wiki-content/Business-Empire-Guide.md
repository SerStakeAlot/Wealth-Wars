## üí° Advanced Management Techniques

### ROI Calculation Methods

#### Simple Payback Period
```
Payback Period = Business Cost √∑ Work Multiplier
Lemonade Stand: 10 √∑ 5 = 2 work actions
Coffee Cafe: 50 √∑ 25 = 2 work actions
Widget Factory: 200 √∑ 100 = 2 work actions
```

#### Portfolio Efficiency Analysis
```
Total Investment = Sum of all business costs
Total Work Multiplier = Sum of all work bonuses
Efficiency Ratio = Total Work Multiplier √∑ Total Investment

Example Portfolio:
- 2 Widget Factories: 400 credits, +200 work bonus
- 1 Coffee Cafe: 50 credits, +25 work bonus
- Total: 450 credits invested, +225 work bonus
- Efficiency: 225 √∑ 450 = 0.5 credits per credit invested
```
