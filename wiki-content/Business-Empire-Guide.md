## üí° Advanced Management Techniques

### ROI Calculation Methods

#### Simple Payback Period
```
Payback Period = Business Cost √∑ Click Bonus
Lemonade Stand: 50 √∑ 1 = 50 clicks
Coffee Cafe: 500 √∑ 5 = 100 clicks
Widget Factory: 2,000 √∑ 20 = 100 clicks
```

#### Portfolio Efficiency Analysis
```
Total Investment = Sum of all business costs
Total Click Bonus = Sum of all click bonuses
Efficiency Ratio = Total Click Bonus √∑ Total Investment

Example Portfolio:
- 2 Widget Factories: 4,000 credits, +40 click bonus
- 1 Coffee Cafe: 500 credits, +5 click bonus
- Total: 4,500 credits invested, +45 click bonus
- Efficiency: 45 √∑ 4,500 = 0.01 credits per credit invested
```

### Business Replacement Strategy

1. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Compare upgrade cost vs. benefit increase
2. **Liquidity Management**: Ensure sufficient credits for operations
3. **Risk Assessment**: Balance portfolio stability with growth
