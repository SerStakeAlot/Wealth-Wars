# Daily Work System

Master the core earning mechanic of Wealth Wars through meaningful daily work actions that grow in power and teach real-world financial concepts.

## üíº Understanding Daily Work

### **What is Daily Work?**
Daily Work is Wealth Wars' core earning mechanic - a single, powerful action you perform once per day that represents your business efforts. Unlike mindless clicking, each work action has significant value and grows more powerful as you progress.

### **Core Principles**
- **One Meaningful Action**: Quality over quantity - one powerful work per day
- **Growing Value**: Each work action becomes worth more over time
- **Business Multiplication**: Owned businesses multiply your work effectiveness
- **Strategic Timing**: Cooldown management and frequency unlocks add depth

## üìà Work Value Calculation

### **Base Formula**
```
Work Value = Base Credits (10) + Streak Bonus (Days √ó 2) + Business Multipliers

Where:
- Base Credits: 10 (represents a full work day)
- Streak Bonus: 2 credits per consecutive day worked
- Business Multipliers: Sum of all business work bonuses
```

### **Business Multipliers**
Your businesses multiply the effectiveness of your work actions:

**ü•§ Lemonade Stand**: +5 credits per work action
- Teaches: Basic entrepreneurial skills
- Investment: 10 credits each
- Strategy: Build 3-5 stands for solid foundation

**‚òï Coffee Cafe**: +25 credits per work action  
- Teaches: Advanced business management
- Investment: 50 credits each
- Strategy: Build 2-3 cafes for major boost

**üè≠ Widget Factory**: +100 credits per work action
- Teaches: Industrial-scale operations
- Investment: 200 credits each
- Strategy: Build 1-2 factories for massive scaling

### **Progression Examples**

**Month 1 (Beginner)**
```
Day 1: 10 + (1 √ó 2) + 0 = 12 credits
Day 7: 10 + (7 √ó 2) + 5 = 29 credits (with 1 stand)
Day 30: 10 + (30 √ó 2) + 35 = 105 credits (2 stands, 1 cafe)
```

**Month 3 (Intermediate)**  
```
Day 90: 10 + (90 √ó 2) + 300 = 490 credits
Business Portfolio: 5 stands + 3 cafes + 1 factory
```

**Year 1 (Advanced)**
```
Day 365: 10 + (365 √ó 2) + 500 = 1,240 credits
Business Portfolio: 5 stands + 3 cafes + 2 factories
```
